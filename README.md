# Python Bytecode Analysis and Profiling

## Overview

This project is designed to analyze Python scripts by generating their bytecode, counting the bytecode instructions, and profiling their execution. The goal is to identify the most commonly used bytecode instructions across a variety of Python scripts and gain insights into their performance characteristics.

The project consists of the following components:
1. **Bytecode Generation**: Converts a Python script into its bytecode and writes the disassembled bytecode to a file.
2. **Instruction Counting**: Counts the frequency of each bytecode instruction and writes the results to a file.
3. **Profiling**: Profiles the execution of the Python script using `cProfile` and generates a `.prof` file for further analysis.

## File Structure

### 1. `genByteCode_v2.py`
This script is the core of the project. It performs the following tasks:
- **Generate Bytecode**: Reads a Python script, compiles it into bytecode, and writes the disassembled bytecode to a file.
- **Count Instructions**: Counts the frequency of each bytecode instruction and writes the results to a file.
- **Run Profiler**: Profiles the execution of the Python script using `cProfile` and saves the profiling data to a `.prof` file.

#### Usage
```bash
python genByteCode_v2.py <path_to_python_file>
```

#### Outputs
- `<script_name>_bytecode.txt`: Contains the disassembled bytecode of the script.
- `<script_name>_instr_count.txt`: Contains the frequency of each bytecode instruction.
- `<script_name>.prof`: Contains profiling data for the script.

### 2. `matrixMul.py`
This script demonstrates matrix multiplication using the `numpy` library.

#### Usage
Run the script directly:
```bash
python matrixMul.py
```

#### Example Input
Matrix 1:
```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6]]
```

Matrix 2:
```
[[7, 8],
 [9, 10],
 [11, 12]]
```

#### Example Output
Resultant Matrix:
```
[[58, 64],
 [139, 154]]
```

---

### 3. `matrixMulBuiltin.py`
This script demonstrates matrix multiplication using Python's built-in functionality (without `numpy`).

#### Usage
Run the script directly:
```bash
python matrixMulBuiltin.py
```

#### Example Input
Matrix 1:
```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6]]
```

Matrix 2:
```
[[7, 8],
 [9, 10],
 [11, 12]]
```

#### Example Output
Resultant Matrix:
```
[[58, 64],
 [139, 154]]
```

### 4. `quickSort.py`
This script implements the QuickSort algorithm, a popular divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

#### Usage
Run the script directly:
```bash
python quickSort.py
```

#### Example Input
Unsorted List:
```
[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
```

#### Example Output
Sorted List:
```
[1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

#### Code Explanation
1. **Partition Function**:
   - Divides the array into two parts based on a pivot element.
   - Elements smaller than the pivot are moved to the left, and elements greater are moved to the right.

2. **QuickSort Function**:
   - Recursively applies the partitioning process to sort the array.
   - Base case: Stops when the array has one or no elements.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Defines the input array and calls the QuickSort function.
   - Prints the sorted array.

### 5. `perceptron2LayerFinal.py`
This script implements a simple two-layer perceptron (neural network) for binary classification.

#### Usage
Run the script directly:
```bash
python perceptron2LayerFinal.py
```

#### Example Input
Training Data:
```
X = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]
Y = [0, 1, 1, 0]  # XOR problem
```

#### Example Output
Trained Weights:
```
Layer 1 Weights: [[...], [...]]
Layer 2 Weights: [[...]]
```
Predictions:
```
Input: [0, 0], Predicted Output: 0
Input: [0, 1], Predicted Output: 1
Input: [1, 0], Predicted Output: 1
Input: [1, 1], Predicted Output: 0
```

#### Code Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - Randomly initializes weights for the two layers of the perceptron.
   - Defines the activation function (e.g., sigmoid or ReLU).

2. **Forward Propagation**:
   - Computes the output of the first layer using the input and weights.
   - Applies the activation function to the first layer's output.
   - Computes the output of the second layer using the first layer's output and weights.

3. **Backward Propagation**:
   - Calculates the error between the predicted and actual outputs.
   - Updates the weights using gradient descent to minimize the error.

4. **Training Loop**:
   - Iteratively trains the perceptron using the training data.
   - Adjusts weights to improve accuracy over multiple epochs.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Uses the trained weights to predict the output for new inputs.

6. **Main Function**:
   - Defines the training data and initializes the perceptron.
   - Trains the perceptron and prints the final weights.
   - Tests the perceptron on new inputs and prints the predictions.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze a Script**:
   - Run the `genByteCode_v2.py` script with the target Python file as an argument.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python genByteCode_v2.py matrixMul.py
     ```
   - Outputs:
     - `matrixMul_bytecode.txt`: Disassembled bytecode.
     - `matrixMul_instr_count.txt`: Bytecode instruction counts.
     - `matrixMul.prof`: Profiling data.

2. **Profile a Script**:
   - Use the `run_profiler` function in `genByteCode_v2.py` to profile the script.
   - View the profiling results using `snakeviz`:
     ```bash
     snakeviz matrixMul.prof
     ```

3. **Matrix Multiplication**:
   - Compare the performance of matrix multiplication using `numpy` (`matrixMul.py`) and Python's built-in functionality (`matrixMulBuiltin.py`).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `numpy` (for `matrixMul.py`)
- `snakeviz` (for visualizing profiling data)

Install dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install numpy snakeviz
```

## Learnings

For all 4 scripts we have `LOAD_CONST` and `LOAD_NAME` as the ***top most*** used instructions.

## Comparison of matrixMul.py (NumPy) vs matrixMulBuiltin.py

To do a better comparison, I have blown up the `matrix_a` and `matrix_b`:
```bash
matrix_a = [[i + j * 1000 for i in range(200)] for j in range(200)]
matrix_b = [[i + j * 1000 for i in range(200)] for j in range(200)]
```

1. **matrixMul.py (NumPy Implementation)**:
   - The function matrix_multiply_numpy primarily delegates the heavy lifting to the NumPy library by calling `np.dot`.
   - The bytecode shows a direct attribute lookup for the dot method (using LOAD_ATTR dot) on the imported NumPy module, indicating that the computation happens in the optimized C layer.
   - Only a handful of Python-level operations are performed: calling np.dot and then converting the result to a Python list using the tolist method.
   - This results in a very compact bytecode sequence, with most work offloaded to highly efficient, precompiled routine of `np.dot`.
   - After the dot product, the conversion of the NumPy array to a Python list is done via a method call `tolist`, which again is executed at the C level, reducing overhead.
   - If we open the `snakeviz` for this script, we can see the function `matrix_multiply_numpy` took **0.01376 sec** of time.

2. **matrixMulBuiltin.py**:
   - The bytecode begins with a check using `len` to ensure that the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second, with a conditional jump that raises a `ValueError` if the condition fails.
   - The matrix multiplication is implemented with nested `list comprehensions` and `generator expressions`.
   - The bytecode for these comprehensions shows multiple iterations `FOR_ITER` and calls to built-in functions like `zip` and `sum`, each adding layers of Python-level execution.
   - Every multiplication and addition is executed at the Python level.
   - This results in significantly more bytecode instructions and, hence, more overhead for each arithmetic operation.
   - The use of generator expressions and list comprehensions involves creating function objects at runtime (indicated by `MAKE_FUNCTION` in the bytecode), which adds further overhead.
   - If we open the `snakeviz` for this script, we can see the function `matrix_multiply_builtin` took **3.958 sec** of time.

3. **Overall Conclusion**:
   - The `NumPy` version exhibits a lean and highly optimized bytecode sequence because it leverages precompiled, low-level C functions for the dot product and list conversion.
   - The built-in version, while functionally equivalent, shows a much more complex and verbose bytecode pattern due to explicit Python-level looping, dynamic function creation, and multiple built-in function callsâ€”all of which contribute to lower performance for large matrices.
